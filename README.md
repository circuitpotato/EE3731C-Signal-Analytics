# EE3731C-Signal-Analytics

## Description
- Took this course a while back. Attached is my MATLAB code and cheatsheet. 
- Link: https://nusmods.com/courses/EE3731C/signal-analytics

## MATLAB Lab Guide
- I did not type my commands in the command panel (I called them in the main function for neatness)
- Read the README there for more infomation 

## Cheatsheet Guide
- I condensed as many example questions as possible 
- Font size (Word Document): 5.5 --> this is the guaranteed font size I tried that can print on a shitty printer
- If you want smaller font size like font 5, make sure you use a good printer unlike my shitty one :)
