# EE3731C-Signal-Analytics
- Took this course a while back. Attached is my MATLAB code and cheatsheet. 
- Link: https://nusmods.com/courses/EE3731C/signal-analytics
- For my lab assignment, I did not type my commands in the command panel (I called them in the main function for neatness)
- For my cheatsheet, it is very information dense so I suggest just using mine as a reference while writing your own 
- Read the README for each file for more infomation
