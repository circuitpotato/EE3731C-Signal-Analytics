# Cheatsheet Guide
- A4 double sided cheatsheet is allowed in the finals 
- I condensed as many example questions as possible 
- Font size (Word Document): 5.5 --> this is the guaranteed font size I tried that can print on a shitty printer
- If you want smaller font size like font 5, make sure you use a good printer unlike my shitty one :)

## How to Read the Cheatsheet
- Everything is colour coded (best to have colour printer)
- ****1st Half (Classical Signal Chapters):**** Highlighted title font is **black**
- ****2nd Half (Statistical + Pattern Recognition Chapters):**** Highted title font is **white**

## Chapters Included
- Classical Signals Chp 1-4
- Statistical Signals Chp 1-3 (Except chp 3.5 --> because it is the most straightforward)
- Pattern Recognition Chp 1-2
